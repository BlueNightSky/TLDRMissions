Common questions:

Q: The number of simulations is really high. Like over 30,000. Is it broken?

A: Nah, its probably trying to solve something like a Level 60 Elite mission, but you don't have multiple Level 60 followers, so its trying every possible combination of followers and troops because it can't find something that works. You can either let it keep running, and maybe it will find a setup that works, or cancel it and give up on that level 60 elite mission.
